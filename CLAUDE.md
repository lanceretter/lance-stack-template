# lance-stack-template

This repo is the canonical documentation set for Lance's personal stack:
how to set up a new Mac (`NEW-MACHINE-SETUP.md`), the full stack architecture
(`STACK.md`), the mobile pipeline (`MOBILE-APP.md`), auth conventions
(`BETTER-AUTH.md`), and the AI chat surface (`AI-CHAT.md`). It is a docs
repo — no source code lives here.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs/errors → invoke /investigate
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore

## GBrain Search Guidance (configured by /sync-gbrain)
<!-- gstack-gbrain-search-guidance:start -->

GBrain is set up and synced on this machine. The agent should prefer gbrain
over Grep when the question is semantic or when you don't know the exact
identifier yet.

**This worktree is pinned to a worktree-scoped code source** via the
`.gbrain-source` file in the repo root (kubectl-style context). Any
`gbrain code-def`, `code-refs`, `code-callers`, `code-callees`, or `query`
call from anywhere under this worktree routes to that source by default —
no `--source` flag needed. Conductor sibling worktrees of the same repo
each have their own pin and their own indexed pages, so semantic results
match the actual code on disk in this worktree.

Two indexed corpora available via the `gbrain` CLI:
- This worktree's docs (auto-pinned via `.gbrain-source`).
- `~/.gstack/` curated memory (registered as `gstack-brain-<user>` source via
  the existing federation pipeline).

Prefer gbrain when:
- "Where is X handled?" / semantic intent, no exact string yet:
    `gbrain search "<terms>"` or `gbrain query "<question>"`
- "Where is symbol Y defined?" / symbol-based code questions:
    `gbrain code-def <symbol>` or `gbrain code-refs <symbol>`
- "What calls Y?" / "What does Y depend on?":
    `gbrain code-callers <symbol>` / `gbrain code-callees <symbol>`
- "What did we decide last time?" / past plans, retros, learnings:
    `gbrain search "<terms>" --source gstack-brain-<user>`

For fast-moving provider APIs (AI voice/realtime, payments, auth, cloud
runtime knobs), do not rely on memory or old examples alone. Use gbrain to find
the repo's local decision docs, then verify current official provider docs
before changing behavior. When a provider-specific lesson is learned, update
the local docs and run `/sync-gbrain` so future agents retrieve the corrected
guidance instead of repeating stale assumptions.

Grep is still right for known exact strings, regex, multiline patterns, and
file globs. Run `/sync-gbrain` after meaningful doc changes; for ongoing
auto-sync across all worktrees, run `gbrain autopilot --install` once per
machine — gbrain's daemon handles incremental refresh on a schedule.
